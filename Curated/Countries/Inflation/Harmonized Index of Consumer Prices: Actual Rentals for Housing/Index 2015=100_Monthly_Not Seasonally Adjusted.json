    "notes": "The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category \"Actual Rentals for Housing (04.1)\" is a classification of services that includes rent actually paid by tenants or subtenants occupying unfurnished or furnished premises as their main residence; rents actually paid for secondary residences; and payments by households occupying a room in a hotel or boarding house as their main residence. Rentals are all rentals actually paid by tenants, i.e. the rentals the tenant pays to the landlord regardless of any social benefits the tenant receives from public authorities (including payments which at the tenant's discretion go directly to the landlord). Rentals normally include payment for the use of the land on which the property stands, the dwelling occupied, the fixtures and fittings for heating, plumbing, lighting, etc., and, in the case of a dwelling let furnished, the furniture.\n\nRentals also include payment for the use of a garage to provide parking in connection with the dwelling. The garage does not have to be physically contiguous to the dwelling; nor does it have to be leased from the same landlord.\n\nThis category excludes accommodation services of educational establishments and hostels (11.2.0), of holiday villages and holiday centers (11.2.0), and of retirement homes for elderly persons (12.4.0).
