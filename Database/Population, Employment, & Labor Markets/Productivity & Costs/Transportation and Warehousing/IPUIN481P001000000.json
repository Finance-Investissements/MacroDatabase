  "notes": "Intermediate inputs productivity is the efficiency at which intermediate inputs are used in the production of goods and services, measured as output produced per unit of intermediate purchases. Intermediate inputs are the goods and services (including energy, raw materials, semi-finished goods, and services that are purchased from all sources) that are used in the production process to produce other goods or services rather than for final consumption."
